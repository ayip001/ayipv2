Welcome to my personal site. It's a bit messy but please make yourself at home!

You'll find most of my work here like blogs, photography, and projects.

### Little bit about myself:

I was born and raised in Hong Kong, then went to finish high school and begin college in San Francisco.

After working as a fullstack software engineer in the Valley, **blockchain and entrepreneurship** had my attention, and are currently what my focus is at.

## Credits where they are due:

This site is built using the [PersonalBlog](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog) GatsbyJS starter.
